### Examples --- mridangam accompaniment to Carnatic music

Percussion in current Carnatic Music concerts
The main artist is a vocalist or instrumentalist. Mridangam is the main percussion instrument; there could be optional additional percussion such as Ghatam, Kanjira.

Percussion accompaniment is provided for all these facets of the concert :

during the [singing](https://youtu.be/Nvn-7H_GIdA?t=685) or [playing](https://youtu.be/RcUGppUD2J8?t=1412) of the song and to also mark the endings of the sections of a song such as Pallavi, Anupallavi and Charanam
during improvisation such as Neraval (variations to a line of the song) and Kalpana svaram (improvising of svara patterns for a particular line of a song adhering to its underlying tala)
sometimes, during singing of Tanam(mainly in Kerala)
during Pallavi (part of a Ragam Tanam Pallavi)
and of course, during the Tani Avartanam, which is the dedicated percussion solo
in an instrumental concert, here is an instance of the mridangam responding to the kalpana svara improvisation for Vatapi Ganapatim in Adi Tala
in a dance recital, the mridangam echoes the same rhythmic syllables of the nrtta (rhythmic dance) along with judicious embellishments
The only time there is no mridangam percussion is when the artist does the raga alapana or free form improvisation of a raga.
